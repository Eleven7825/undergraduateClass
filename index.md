## Welcome to our website

We will post some useful example code and notes.  It is not required for you to work with this code, only if it is helpful to you.  The instructors are [Charlie Peskin](https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin/) and [Charles Puelz](cpuelz.github.io).  This class is associated with the [Modeling and Simulation RTG grant](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/research/pages/research-and-training-group-mathematical-modeling-and-simulation/) here at Courant.
