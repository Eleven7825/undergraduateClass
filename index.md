## Welcome to our website

Here, we will post some useful example code and notes.  It is not required for you to work with this code, but it may be helpful for getting started.  The instructors are [Charlie Peskin](https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin/) and [Charles Puelz](https://cpuelz.github.io/).  This class is associated with the [Modeling and Simulation RTG grant](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/research/pages/research-and-training-group-mathematical-modeling-and-simulation/) here at Courant.

### Code

-building some structures: [simple_structure_2d.m](simple_structure_2d.m), [simple_structure_3d.m](simple_structure_3d.m)

-building a bicycle: [bicycle.m](bicycle.m)

-2d forward Euler example with a chain of springs: [spring_string.m](spring_string.m)

-2d bouncing ball: [bouncing_ball.m](bouncing_ball.m).  Try varying the spring and dashpot parameters to see how this impacts the dynamics.  Be careful, the set of parameters in this file are close to being unstable with forward Euler :-).

### Notes

Here is a link to some [notes](notes_MATH395.pdf) that will be regularly updated.  These are still a work in progress.
